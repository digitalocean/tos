On rare occasions, a Subscriber may be billed an amount up to the Subscriber's current balance in an effort to verify the authenticity of the Subscriber's account information. This process ensures that Subscribers without a payment history are not subjected to additional scrutiny. Subscribers are entirely responsible for the payment of all taxes. For specific pricing policies, please refer to [https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing). Monthly fees and renewal fees will be billed at the rate agreed to at purchase.

Except in the case of subscription commitments you have agreed to, which shall be **nonrefundable**, as permitted by law, if you cancel, you agree that fees for the first month of Services and any start-up costs associated with setting up your Account ("Start-up Costs") shall be **nonrefundable**, as permitted by law. With the exception of any subscription commitments agreed by you, if you paid fees in advance for any period longer than one month, then you may, with the exception of fees for the first month of Services and any Start-up Costs, obtain a refund on a pro rata basis for the period remaining after you cancel.

5.4 Some of the paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT.

CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT [https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings).

6.4. DigitalOcean may offer "beta" versions or features of the Services (each, a **"Beta Service"**). DigitalOcean will determine, at its sole discretion, the availability, duration (the **"Trial Period"**), features, and components of each Beta Service. For avoidance of doubt, any Beta Service is a form of the Services and the provision and use of any Beta Service is subject to the entirety of this Agreement, unless otherwise provided for in this Section 6.4.

ANY BETA SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE. DIGITALOCEAN SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH REGARD TO ANY BETA SERVICE. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event will DigitalOcean be liable to you or any third party for any damages or liability related to, arising out of, or caused by any Beta Service and/or any modification, suspension, or termination thereof. If DigitalOcean permits you to use a Beta Service, you agree to provide DigitalOcean Feedback and respond to DigitalOcean's questions or other inquiries regarding your use of the Beta Service, if requested and as applicable. If DigitalOcean permits you to use a Beta Service, you specifically agree, in addition to the requirements set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement, to not: (i) use the Beta Service for benchmarking or performance testing or publicly disseminate performance information or analysis from any source relating to the Service; (ii) modify or create derivative works of the Beta Service or remove any product identification, proprietary, copyright or other notices contained in the Beta Service; or (iii) allow any other individual to access or use the Beta Service. DigitalOcean at its sole discretion shall determine whether or not to continue to offer any Beta Service, and may cease offering any Beta Service at any time. Upon completion of a Trial Period, you may lose access to the applicable Beta Service, unless or until the features of the Beta Service are incorporated into the Services, and you agree to return or destroy all copies of documentation and confidential information related to the Beta Service. Any production candidate or non-production version of the Services will be considered a Beta Service.

Subscriber grants to DigitalOcean a limited license to use, reproduce, distribute, and display any data provided to DigitalOcean by Subscriber and/or any user of a Beta Service solely for facilitating the purposes of this Agreement (such data collectively, "Beta Data") (i) as required to provide the Beta Service; and (ii) in de-identified form, to tune, enhance and improve the Service and other DigitalOcean products and services. Subscriber represents and warrants that it has all necessary rights to grant DigitalOcean the rights set forth in this Section, and that it will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Beta Data. DigitalOcean may use de-identified or aggregated Beta Data collected through a Beta Service for any purpose, including, without limitation, to enhance and improve the Services.

WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO ASSUME THE EXCLUSIVE DEFENSE AND CONTROL OF ANY MATTER OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION BY YOU, IN WHICH EVENT YOU WILL ASSIST AND COOPERATE WITH US IN ASSERTING ANY AVAILABLE DEFENSES.

## 12\. Termination and Access

12.1 DigitalOcean reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate your access to all or any part of the Services at any time, with or without notice, effective immediately, including but not limited to as a result of your violation of any of these Terms of Service or any law, or if you misuse system resources, such as, by employing programs that consume excessive network capacity, CPU cycles, or disk IO. Any such termination may result in the forfeiture and destruction of information associated with your Account. DigitalOcean may provide prior notice of the intent to terminate Services to you if such notice will not, in DigitalOcean's discretion, run counter to the intents and purposes of these Terms of Service. Except as otherwise set forth hereunder, any and all fees paid hereunder are non-refundable and any and all fees owed to DigitalOcean before such termination shall be immediately due and payable, including any liabilities that may have been incurred prior to termination such as DigitalOcean's costs for collection (including attorneys' fees) of any such charges or other liabilities. Upon termination, any and all rights granted to Subscriber by this Agreement will immediately be terminated, and Subscriber shall promptly discontinue all use of the Services. If you wish to terminate your Account, you may do so by following the instructions on the Website or through the Services. All provisions of these Terms of Service which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, licenses of User Content, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

## 13\. Choice of Law, Venue, Consent to Email Service and Waiver of Hague Convention Service Formalities

13.1 Any claim arising hereunder shall be construed in accordance with the substantive and procedural laws of the State of New York, without regard to principles of conflict of laws. Subject to Section 15 below, you agree that any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms of Service shall be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and Federal courts of New York County, New York. Subscriber consents to service of process via email at the email address(es) provided by Subscriber, and waives any requirement under the Hague Convention or other judicial treaty requiring that legal process be translated into any language other than English.

## 14\. Dispute Resolution

14.1 Mindful of the high cost of litigation, you and DigitalOcean agree to the following dispute resolution procedure: in the event of any controversy, claim, action or dispute arising out of or related to: (i) the Website; (ii) this Agreement; (iii) the Services; (iv) the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of this Agreement; or (v) any other dispute between you and DigitalOcean ("Dispute"), the party asserting the Dispute shall first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the other party (by first class or registered mail) describing the facts and circumstances (including any relevant documentation) of the Dispute and allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond to or settle the Dispute. Notice shall be sent (1) if to DigitalOcean at: 101 Avenue of the Americas, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10013 or (2) if to you at: your last-used billing address or the billing and/or shipping address in your Account information. Both you and DigitalOcean agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent that must be satisfied prior to initiating any arbitration or filing any claim against the other party.

## 15\. Mandatory Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver

15.1 In the interest of resolving disputes between you and DigitalOcean in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and DigitalOcean agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND DIGITALOCEAN ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. This Section 15 will not apply to disputes arising under the U.S.-EU/U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor frameworks, which shall instead be administered under the rules for the resolution of disputes arising under the Safe Harbor frameworks specified in the DigitalOcean Safe Harbor filing with the U.S. Department of Commerce.

15.2 Despite the provisions of Section 15.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

15.3 Any arbitration between you and DigitalOcean will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting DigitalOcean.

15.4 A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail ("Notice"). DigitalOcean's address for Notice is: DigitalOcean, 101 Avenue of the Americas, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10013. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or DigitalOcean may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or DigitalOcean must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, DigitalOcean will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by DigitalOcean in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award; or (iii) $1,000.

15.5 If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, DigitalOcean will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in New York, New York, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse DigitalOcean for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.

15.6 YOU AND DIGITALOCEAN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and DigitalOcean agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

15.7 If DigitalOcean makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to DigitalOcean's address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to DigitalOcean's address for Notice, in which case your account with DigitalOcean will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

15.8 If Section 15.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 15 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 13 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.

## 16\. Miscellaneous Provisions

16.1 Neither you nor DigitalOcean shall be liable for nonperformance of the terms herein to the extent that either you or DigitalOcean are prevented from performing as a result of any act or event which occurs and is beyond your or DigitalOcean's reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, war, unrest or riot, strikes, any action of a governmental entity, weather, quarantine, fire, flood, earthquake, explosion, utility or telecommunications outages, Internet disturbance, or any unforeseen change in circumstances, or any other causes beyond either party's reasonable control.

16.5 This Agreement, including all related agreements and policies incorporated by reference herein, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties related to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreement between the parties relating to the Services. A valid waiver hereunder shall not be interpreted to be a waiver of that obligation in the future or any other obligation under this Agreement. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms of Service to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives. If any provision of this Agreement is prohibited by law or held to be unenforceable, that provision will be severed and the remaining provisions hereof shall not be affected such that this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as if such unenforceable provision had never constituted a part hereof. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute the same instrument. This Agreement may be signed electronically or, as set out above, your access and use of the Services will manifest your consent to this Agreement. These Terms of Service are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our rights and obligations hereunder without consent.
